## Classic Markdown to PDF
If you have an account at Classic Markdown to PDF, don't worry, your files are safe. You can log in at [classic.markdowntopdf.com](https://classic.markdowntopdf.com).

## Privacy First
At PDF Equips, we prioritize your privacy. Unlike version 1 of Markdown to PDF, your content is no longer stored in a file before being read/converted and subsequently removed from our servers. Instead, your content is now sent securely via our API before returning the converted file. This ensures that your data is never stored and remains secure.

## GitHub-Flavored Styling by Default
We use GitHub-flavored styling by default, so your PDF files will have a clean and modern look.

## Image Support
Images are base64-encoded into the PDF document, so they do not depend on a remote source that could go offline, rendering your image broken. Moreover, they do not require an internet connection.

## Next Steps
Up next, we're working on Emoji support, which will make your PDF documents more fun and expressive! Stay tuned for more updates.
